# Design Token API

The purpose of this project is to allow you to abstract design decisions from any platform in a single location.

## Diary

So far I have:

- created the folder structure
- implemented a compiler for ES6
- tested a simple function using template literals
- added loop through list of plugins functionality

## Todo

- Specify where file should output (how should this work considering it should support formats/different platforms?)
- Create an easier way to output strings
- Test how to reference values from own config
- Look at how to add unit tests

## Usage

To use this project first install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the application to test it

```bash
npm start
```
